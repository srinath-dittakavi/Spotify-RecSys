{"cells":[{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["# **Spotify Recommender System**\n","\n","Welcome to my project on building a Spotify Recommender System! In this project, I've undertaken the task of developing a recommendation system using a rich Spotify Tracks dataset sourced from (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/maharshipandya/-spotify-tracks-dataset). This dataset comprises a comprehensive collection of Spotify tracks spanning a diverse array of 125 different genres. Each track is accompanied by a wealth of audio features, including artist information, danceability, energy, valence, and many more.\n","\n","**Project Motivation**\n","\n","The primary motivation behind this endeavor is to put into practice the machine learning knowledge I've acquired, both in academic settings and through various online courses. By working on a real-world application like this, I aim to leverage data science techniques to solve a practical problem — in this case, helping music enthusiasts discover new songs that align with their tastes.\n","\n","**The Dataset**\n","\n","The core of this project lies in the Spotify tracks dataset, which is a goldmine of information for music lovers and data enthusiasts alike. It encompasses a vast and diverse collection of tracks, offering a window into the world of music through data. This dataset is not only a treasure trove for building a recommendation system but also a playground for exploring the intricacies of music from a data-driven perspective.\n","\n","**Building the Recommender System**\n","\n","Building a Spotify Recommender System is a multi-faceted challenge. It involves harnessing the power of machine learning algorithms to analyze patterns and relationships within the dataset. By doing so, I can create a personalized music recommendation engine that understands individual preferences and suggests songs that are likely to resonate with each user's unique taste.\n","\n","\n","So, let's dive into the Recommender System!"],"metadata":{"id":"1G0WqAPMN9ND"}},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":18,"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"executionInfo":{"elapsed":866,"status":"ok","timestamp":1695441844173,"user":{"displayName":"Srinath Dittakavi","userId":"11144235962313191069"},"user_tz":240},"id":"MlPJZFFrV0fi","outputId":"a165ebd3-880d-4d1e-ecf8-3d73f2f54159"},"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["Drive already mounted at /content/gdrive; to attempt to forcibly remount, call drive.mount(\"/content/gdrive\", force_remount=True).\n"]}],"source":["from google.colab import drive\n","drive.mount('/content/gdrive')"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":19,"metadata":{"id":"J7V0AE5Fh0Y6","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1695441844174,"user_tz":240,"elapsed":5,"user":{"displayName":"Srinath Dittakavi","userId":"11144235962313191069"}}},"outputs":[],"source":["import os\n","import pandas as pd\n","import random\n","import numpy as np\n","from sklearn.feature_extraction.text import TfidfVectorizer\n","from sklearn.metrics.pairwise import linear_kernel\n","from sklearn.preprocessing import MinMaxScaler\n","from sklearn.cluster import KMeans"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["# **Streamlining Data Preparation: From Raw to Ready**\n","\n","Below, I've imported the data and merged essential features from various datasets.

Recommendations are generated, and the top matches (e.g., 10) are displayed with song names, artists, and release years.

Equally weighting both recommender systems with a weight of 0.5 each, the code processes each of the user's chosen songs through both recommendation engines, resulting in 10 song recommendations from each system, totaling 20 songs. After all three songs have generated their recommendations, the combined list is meticulously ranked, and the cream of the crop— the top 10 songs—are presented to the user for their listening pleasure. This fusion of recommendation methods ensures a diverse and personalized music selection tailored to the user's unique tastes."],"metadata":{"id":"HO5A1hEIGFEQ"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["combined_recommendations = {}\n","for song in picked_songs:\n","    cf_recs = Spotify_Recommendation(dataset).recommend(str(song), 10)\n","    content_recs = Spotify_ContentBasedRecommendation(dataset, cosine_sim).recommend(song, 10)\n","    combined_recs = {}\n","    for rec in cf_recs:\n","        combined_recs[rec['name']] = 0.5\n","    for rec in content_recs:\n","        combined_recs[rec['name']] = combined_recs.get(rec['name'], 0) + 0.5\n","    combined_recommendations[song] = list(combined_recs.keys())\n","final_recommendations = []\n","for song, rec_list in combined_recommendations.items():\n","    combined_scores = {}\n","    for idx, rec_name in enumerate(rec_list):\n","        combined_scores[rec_name] = combined_scores.get(rec_name, 0) + (idx + 1)\n","    sorted_combined = sorted(combined_scores.keys(), key=lambda x: combined_scores[x])\n","    final_recommendations.extend(sorted_combined)\n","\n","final_recommendations = final_recommendations[:10]\n","\n","\n","print(\"\\t Recommended Songs: \\n\")\n","for idx, song in enumerate(final_recommendations, start=1):\n","    song_info = dataset[dataset['name'] == song].iloc[0]\n","    song_name = song_info['name']\n","    artists = song_info['artists']\n","    release_date = song_info['release_date']\n","\n","    print(f\"{idx}\\t Song Name: {song_name}\\n\\t Artists: {artists}\\n\\t Release Date: {release_date} \\n\")"],"metadata":{"id":"6NoB8ZVgzLFW","colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1695441984926,"user_tz":240,"elapsed":4986,"user":{"displayName":"Srinath Dittakavi","userId":"11144235962313191069"}},"outputId":"b8244b01-284e-4176-cda3-da72d8f41c9d"},"execution_count":32,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["\t Recommended Songs: \n","\n","1\t Song Name: Wie man Freunde gewinnt - Die Kunst, beliebt und einflussreich zu werden, Kapitel 54\n","\t Artists: ['Dale Carnegie', 'Till Hagen', 'Stefan Kaminski']\n","\t Release Date: 1936 \n","\n","2\t Song Name: Invitation - Instrumental\n","\t Artists: ['Cal Tjader']\n","\t Release Date: 1959-01-01 \n","\n","3\t Song Name: Foe Life\n","\t Artists: ['Mack 10', 'Ice Cube']\n","\t Release Date: 1995-01-01 \n","\n","4\t Song Name: Goomba Boomba - Remastered\n","\t Artists: ['Billy May', 'Yma Sumac']\n","\t Release Date: 1954 \n","\n","5\t Song Name: Never No Lament\n","\t Artists: ['Duke Ellington', 'Duke Ellington Orchestra']\n","\t Release Date: 1940-01-01 \n","\n","6\t Song Name: Il Ragazzo Della Via Gluck - Remastered\n","\t Artists: ['Adriano Celentano']\n","\t Release Date: 1966 \n","\n","7\t Song Name: Treat Her Like A Lady\n","\t Artists: ['The Temptations']\n","\t Release Date: 1997-01-01 \n","\n","8\t Song Name: Doin' Time - Original Version\n","\t Artists: ['Sublime']\n","\t Release Date: 1996-07-30 \n","\n","9\t Song Name: Best Thing I Never Had\n","\t Artists: ['Beyoncé']\n","\t Release Date: 2011-06-24 \n","\n","10\t Song Name: Midnight Special\n","\t Artists: ['Creedence Clearwater Revival']\n","\t Release Date: 1969-11-02 \n","\n"]}]}],"metadata":{"colab":{"provenance":[{"file_id":"1rEKSR7yXQxBEMToMo632lts28IHVtZ3K","timestamp":1694739445761}]},"kernelspec":{"display_name":"Python 3","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"name":"python"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":0}
