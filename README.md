Quick Summary: Developed a Spotify Recommender System using K-Means Clustering and Content-Based methods on a diverse dataset of 125 genres, delivering personalized song recommendations for music enthusiasts.


Welcome to my project on building a Spotify Recommender System! In this project, I've undertaken the task of developing a recommendation system using a rich Spotify Tracks dataset sourced from (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/maharshipandya/-spotify-tracks-dataset). This dataset comprises a comprehensive collection of Spotify tracks spanning a diverse array of 125 different genres. Each track is accompanied by a wealth of audio features, including artist information, danceability, energy, valence, and many more.

Project Motivation

The primary motivation behind this endeavor is to put into practice the machine learning knowledge I've acquired, both in academic settings and through various online courses. By working on a real-world application like this, I aim to leverage data science techniques to solve a practical problem â€” in this case, helping music enthusiasts discover new songs that align with their tastes.

The Dataset

The core of this project lies in the Spotify tracks dataset, which is a goldmine of information for music lovers and data enthusiasts alike. It encompasses a vast and diverse collection of tracks, offering a window into the world of music through data. This dataset is not only a treasure trove for building a recommendation system but also a playground for exploring the intricacies of music from a data-driven perspective.

Building the Recommender System

Building a Spotify Recommender System is a multi-faceted challenge. It involves harnessing the power of machine learning algorithms to analyze patterns and relationships within the dataset. By doing so, I can create a personalized music recommendation engine that understands individual preferences and suggests songs that are likely to resonate with each user's unique taste.

So, let's dive into the Recommender System!
